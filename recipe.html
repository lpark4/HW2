    <p>In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they contain, we created a Recipe <br>
    Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart show the <br />
    nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a <br />
    table that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain<br />
    it. It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this <br />
    recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good -<br />
    please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe<br />
    and the number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based on a single serving. For example, if a recipe makes<br />
    4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the chart by eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe.<br />
    Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily<br />
    Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we<br />
    established in our rating system. For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are found<br />
    in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." <a href="www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=faq&dbid=22">
