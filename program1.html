                <span class="bold">Breakfast</span><br />Koreans don't really have a breakfast category like the U.S.
                When I say breakfast category, I mean to say that we don't categorize any food
                in particular to be breakfast food. For example, in America, for breakfast there
                are french toast, eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles, pancakes, etc. In Korea, traditionally,
                we don't have those but nowadays since Korea is now more accepting to the Western culture,
                we have implemented American breakfast into our daily lives. Koreans eat regular meals. For
                breakfast, I will not post any recipes since they consist of any other meal of the day for us.

        <p>BUT, here's a simple American breakfast recipe for <span class="french">French Toast!</span> </p>

                    <li>
                        In a medium sized bowl, crack in the 4 eggs and add to the bowl, as well
                        as the 1 cup of milk,<br /> 1 tbsp vanilla, and 1 tbsp of cinnamon.

                    <li>
                        Dunk the slices of bread one at a time and put in a frying pan. Heat until
                        golden brown.

                    <li>Now you can eat it with your choice of maple syrup or honey!</li>
                    <li>
                        (OPTIONAL): you may add slices of butter on top of the hot toast, powdered sugar,
                        or fresh fruits.
                    </li>

                Rice and chopsticks are a must! If you do not know how to use chopsticks, please
                follow this <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8mw8SWS5nM">link</a> by Howcast.<br />
                If you would prefer to be healthy, you can use brown rice or quinoa as an alternative.

                For lunch, since it is the winter, I have decided to put budae jjigae on the menu. Budae jjigae translated in English means "Army Base Stew".
                Army base stew is a Korean/American fusion since it consists of spam, sausages, cheese (optional) and baked beans. The reason for the name
                of this stew is because it is a very common dish in the Korean military when in the 1950's, there were limited ingredients, they created a
                stew with whatever they can manage to put in there.
