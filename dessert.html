        <h3>Dessert, the best part of the day!</h3>
        <p class="d1">Patbingsu is a cold dessert but they always taste better in the winter time. (At least for me, that is. Am I the only one?) 
        So "pat" stands for the sweetened adzuki red beans in the dessert and "bingsu" means shaved ice. For this dessert, you will need
        an electric or manual ice shaving machine, which you can easily find in Asian markets like H-Mart, Assi, or even online. If you do not feel the
        need to purchase such an item (for convenience), then you may find alternatives for shaving your ice (you may crush the ice in a ziplock bag AKA "forking").</p>
